## 👋 Welcome to the Awesome-FOSS project management repository!

This repo is used mostly to manage collaboration between [@emmet0r](https://github.com/emmet0r) and [@Nandinisaagar](https://github.com/Nandinisaagar) around engaging high school students in open source. 

You can find our active project in the [AwesomeFOSS](https://github.com/awesomefoss) GitHub organization, including repos-in-progress to support interactive workshop activities + a blog sharing helpful content for new contributors. (Most credit goes to Nandini for what you see so far! 🏆)

You can also follow us on Instagram at [@awesomefoss](https://www.instagram.com/awesomefoss/)
